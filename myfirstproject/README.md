# My First Project

## 1. The Aim

I want to make a website that roles a dice. This includes a few features, shows git use and uses github showing pushes:

### 2. Features:
- uses images from my g drive
- clicking button triggers the role
- shows the image changing for 3 seconds
- 'lands' on a result, showing that image
- a pop up tells you what the result was
