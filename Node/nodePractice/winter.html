    <h1>Winter!!!  Go dance in the winter wonderland.</h1>
    <h2>Enjoy some Brad Paisley by the fire.</h2>
    <p>Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
        In the lane, snow is glistening
        A beautiful sight,
        We're happy tonight,
        Walking in a winter wonderland.
        Gone away is the bluebird,
        Here to stay is a new bird
        He sings a love song,
        As we go along,
        Walking in a winter wonderland.
        In the meadow we can build a snowman,
        Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
        He'll say: Are you married?
        We'll say: No man,
        But you can do the job
        When you're in town.
        Later on, we'll conspire,
        As we dream by the fire
        To face unafraid,
        The plans that we've made,
        Walking in a winter wonderland.
        In the meadow we can build a snowman,
        And pretend that he's a circus clown
        We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
        Until the other kiddies knock him down.
        When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
        Though your nose gets a chilling
        We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
        Walking in a winter wonderland.
        Walking in a winter wonderland,
        Walking in a winter wonderland.</p>
