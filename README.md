# Coding Projects Repository

Welcome to my Coding Projects Repository! This repository contains all the small projects I've been working on while learning to code. Each folder represents a different project, often exploring new concepts or practicing specific programming skills.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

1. **C#**
   - Projects created using the C# programming language.
   - Focus on learning .NET, object-oriented programming, and other C# fundamentals.

2. **JavaScript**
   - Projects developed using JavaScript.
   - Exploring DOM manipulation, basic algorithms, and web development concepts.

3. **Learning Random**
   - Miscellaneous projects exploring random topics, languages, or concepts.
   - Perfect for trying out new tools or ideas.

4. **myfirstproject**
   - The first coding project I ever created.
   - A milestone in my coding journey!

## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning archive to track my progress and growth as I explore various programming languages and tools. Feel free to browse the projects, review the code, and see the evolution of my coding skills.
